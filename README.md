In This HW2 we create two apps which one app checks if inputted password string is good enough or should be changed with the size of blocks in the passwords. The other app 
is the Scrabble App in which gets a inputted string of characters less or equal to 7 characters and makes different permutations of how the tiles can be arranged.
